function pts3d = triangulate(P1, pts1, P2, pts2 )
% triangulate estimate the 3D positions of points from 2d correspondence
%   Args:
%       P1:     projection matrix with shape 3 x 4 for image 1
%       pts1:   coordinates of points with shape N x 2 on image 1
%       P2:     projection matrix with shape 3 x 4 for image 2
%       pts2:   coordinates of points with shape N x 2 on image 2
%
%   Returns:
%       Pts3d:  coordinates of 3D points with shape N x 3
